# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3Ã—3 grid. The game is simple yet strategic, requiring players to take turns marking spaces with either an "X" or an "O". The primary objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three of the same symbol before the opponent does.
